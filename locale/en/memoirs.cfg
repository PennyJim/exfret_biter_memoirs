# If you ever leave out a gendered form, it should fall back to the ungendered form
# So prioritize Ungendered Forms, and feel free to leave out duplicates

# The only reason English has duplicates, is because crowdin can't understand the
# dynamic keys that we have, so we need each one for crowdin to be able to translate it.
