reload-names=Biter Memoirs: Mod configuration changed, reloading names list.

#MARK: Format description
# We are abusing the plural syntax for gender :D
# The 1st parameter is the name
# The 2nd parameter is the gender:
#		rest : ungendered
#      1 : Male
#      2 : Female
#   More can be added if needed, but I'll need help classifying the names.

# Some languages might need to surround the whole sentence with a __plural_for_parameter__2__{}__, but it *works*

# Copy and paste for some quick pronoun switching:
# __plural_for_parameter__2__{rest=their|2=her|1=his}__
# __plural_for_parameter__2__{rest=they|2=she|1=he}__
# __plural_for_parameter__2__{rest=them|2=her|1=him}__
